    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For sometime I have been meaning to make a move to another blog host, or even write my own blog site. Well, atlast, I have done something about it. I decided to use <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> as my blog &#8216;engine&#8217; and GitHub Pages as the host.</p>

<p>The thought of writing my own blog from the ground up sounded kind of appealing, but that would take some time and effort and I would probably not learn a huge amount in the process. I would rather dedicate that time to learning something that really interests me, like writing my own Routing Slip implementation.</p>

<p>So, I thought <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> / <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub</a> Pages was a good half-way house; I have more control over the site than most traditional blog sites, I am using GitHub every day to write my posts, I feel like a hacker but I am not having to write and maintain all the low level stuff had I written the site from scratch.</p>

<p>This blog will also give me the chance to &#8220;start over&#8221; - I want to blog more often. Hopefully this will give me some inspiration and I can make smaller, more frequent additions.</p>

<p>My next task is to migrate the content from TypePad to here.</p>
